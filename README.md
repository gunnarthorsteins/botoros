This is really stupid, but anyway.

Dos Toros is a NYC burrito place. It gives one a $6 off the first order for an account. The account setup is rather simple: one can provide practically any name and phone number, only the email must be uniqueâ€”and it isn't verified.

Therefore, this leverages that to fill out my favorite order and get a $6 discount every time. It's only semi-automatic, as the payment step still must be manually filled in for security reasons.

'uge thanks to my friend the graphite guru for the tip.

### Usage

Change stuff in `botoros/config.py` to your liking, then run

```python main.py``````
